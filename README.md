About this repo:

Here are all of the projects in SWEN20003. Hope this helps anyone taking this course in the future!

**Projects 1 and 2 are essentially about the same thing: implementing a simple game using Java.** While the game itself might change from year to year, the programming skills required remain **largely the same**. Project 1 asks for a basic version—for instance, in 2025 S2, we had to build a simplified version of "Shadow Dungeon." Project 2 is basically an **enhanced version** of Project 1; it requires adding more features to your initial build and includes creating a UML class diagram as a prerequisite task (which is called Project2A). Overall, these projects aren't too difficult **as long as you're willing to put in the time**, and the grading is very generous. I ended up with a score of 28.8/30.

Beyond the projects (which make up 30% of your grade), if you're aiming for a high score, **make sure to attend the lectures and tutorials**—they each account for 5%. The most critical part remains the exams, which are worth 60% in total (10% Midterm, 50% Final).

As an international student with average English, I was a bit overconfident in my prior knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I went into the midterm without much revision and only managed a 5/10. The midterm is entirely multiple-choice and **focuses heavily on conceptual understanding**, so I can't stress enough: read the lecture slides thoroughly!

For the final exam, **hands-on coding practice is much more important.** Because the exam is quite long, don’t just look at a problem and assume you know the logic—actually write the code during your revision. This is the best way to ensure a better grade. I ended up with a final score of 84/100. Best of luck to everyone—I hope you all pass and secure that H1!
